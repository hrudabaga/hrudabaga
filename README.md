Hello!

I'm an undergrad student at Arizona State University majoring in Computer Science. 
My long term goal is to become a Cyber Security specialist with clearance. 
Currently, I want to learn ethical hacking. 
Do I know a great track for doing that yet? 
No. 
But I'm bouncing around the internet trying to learn. 

GitHub is one of the coolest things the internet has ever done.
I'm grateful that there are parts of the internet that are still cool.
